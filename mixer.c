/* This could be optimized a lot by writing separate functions for non-looping, forwards, and pingpong, 8-
and 16-bit, surround, maybe for pure left/right/center panning, etc. Essentially, instead of having one
function that does a lot, have a lot of little ones that are as short as possible, because any conditionals
will slow down the mixing. (although it's not really possible to get rid of the sample length check...) A
further optimization would be to check if the voice's volume is zero and increment the position without doing
any mixing. The non-mixing, non-looping function might even be reduced to voice->cur += (size * voice->inc)
and stopping the sample if it goes past the length. */
