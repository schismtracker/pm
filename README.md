This is a git conversion of
[the original cvs repository at sourceforge](https://schismtracker.cvs.sourceforge.net/),
created in the interest of preserving proper commit history. This code has not
been maintained since 2005, and these days it primarily serves as a historical
artifact.

Don't expect anything here to work, let alone compile.
